Some documentation to refer to:

- Our main web socket (mWS) sends opcode 4 with a guild ID and channel ID.
- The mWS receives VOICE_STATE_UPDATE and VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- We pull the session_id from VOICE_STATE_UPDATE.
- We pull the token, endpoint and server_id from VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- Then we initiate the voice web socket (vWS) pointing to the endpoint.
- We send opcode 0 with the user_id, server_id, session_id and token using the vWS.
- The vWS sends back opcode 2 with an ssrc, port, modes(array) and hearbeat_interval.
- We send a UDP discovery packet to endpoint:port and receive our IP and our port in LE.
- Then we send our IP and port via vWS with opcode 1.
- When that's all done, we receive opcode 4 from the vWS.
- Finally we can transmit data to endpoint:port.

    This is an abstract class. The library provides a concrete implementation
    under :class:`VoiceClient`.

    This class allows you to implement a protocol to allow for an external
    method of sending voice, such as Lavalink_ or a native library implementation.

    These classes are passed to :meth:`abc.Connectable.connect`.

    .. _Lavalink: https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink

    Parameters
    ------------
    client: :class:`Client`
        The client (or its subclasses) that started the connection request.
    channel: :class:`abc.Connectable`
        The voice channel that is being connected to.

        """|coro|

        An abstract method called when the client initiates the connection request.

        When a connection is requested initially, the library calls the constructor
        under ``__init__`` and then calls :meth:`connect`. If :meth:`connect` fails at
        some point then :meth:`disconnect` is called.

        Within this method, to start the voice connection flow it is recommended to
        use :meth:`Guild.change_voice_state` to start the flow. After which,
        :meth:`on_voice_server_update` and :meth:`on_voice_state_update` will be called.
        The order that these two are called is unspecified.

        Parameters
        ------------
        timeout: :class:`float`
            The timeout for the connection.
        reconnect: :class:`bool`
